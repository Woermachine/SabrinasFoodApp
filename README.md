# SabrinasFoodApp

This is a fun little side project, not to be taken too seriously.

My fiance and I often have the talk:

> "What do you feel like for dinner?"
> 
> "I don't know, what about you?"

So to help answer that question I made this little app for us with some of our favorites to decide.

A few features:

* Filtering - Include (must have), Exclude (Cannot have), Optional (On the list of options) 
  * Example: Optional: Pizza, Mexican, Sushi. Must have: Delivery
* Sorts by distance from your location

Potential improvements:
* Could hook into the Google Places API
* Could add a review system to dynamically weight options
* Could integrate with Doordash
* Could add options to launch a navigation intent to the business address
* Could add more restaurants
* Could add a light weight backend to store preferences
